# Why is IRS Sharing Sensitive Taxpayer Data with Google and Akamai?

## Lede

When Americans apply for an EIN ‚Äî registering a business, trust, or estate ‚Äî they expect the IRS to protect their most sensitive data.  
Our analysis shows the EIN portal includes first-party Google Tag Manager (`GTM-KV978ZL`) and GA4 (`G-ZY6FM95CS5`) scripts in the page `<head>`, and Akamai edge telemetry cookies (`_abck`, `bm_sz`, `akaalb_*`) on initial responses.  
Because the Google and Akamai scripts execute in the main document context, they have the technical capability to read page DOM elements (including form inputs) and hook XHR/fetch to observe payloads.

## Key Evidence (see `/evidence`)

1. **HTML snapshot** with GTM/GA scripts in the `<head>`.
2. **HAR capture** showing `Set-Cookie` for Akamai cookies and network requests to `googletagmanager`/`google-analytics`.
3. **TLS cert dump** showing Let's Encrypt issuer on the Akamai edge.
4. **Console snippets** demonstrating that DOM and XHR hook capability exists (no PII recorded).
5. **AWS Application Load Balancer cookies (`AWSALB*`)** observed in responses, indicating IRS origin traffic traverses AWS-managed infrastructure.

---

## Trust Assumptions

1. **Google scripts**: Any JS loaded from `googletagmanager.com` runs in the same execution context as the IRS application, with full DOM access and ability to hook network calls.
2. **Akamai edge**: TLS terminates on Akamai infrastructure. This means decrypted taxpayer traffic exists in memory at a commercial CDN.
3. **AWS load balancer**: Presence of `AWSALB*` cookies shows another termination and routing point in the data path.
4. **Validator absence**: There is no public evidence of FedRAMP validators or independent oversight certifying these third-party components in this workflow.
5. **End-user opacity**: Taxpayers‚Äô browsers cannot verify how traffic is protected or segmented once it leaves Akamai.

## TLS Termination at Akamai: A Perfect MITM Setup

- **Observed**: TLS certificates are issued by Let‚Äôs Encrypt, not a .gov CA, and bound to Akamai edge servers.
- **Implication**: Although the browser shows a lock, taxpayer data is decrypted at the CDN edge before being forwarded to the IRS.
- **Result**: Akamai sits in the ‚Äúman-in-the-middle‚Äù position ‚Äî a role normally considered a security red flag ‚Äî except here it is authorized by contract.

## Data Path Between TLS Endpoint and IRS/AWS Origins

Once TLS terminates at Akamai‚Äôs edge:

1. **Re-encryption hop:** Akamai re-establishes a new TLS tunnel from its PoP to the IRS/AWS origin (SSL bridging).
2. **Trust transfer:** Two distinct TLS sessions exist:
    - Client ‚Üî Akamai (cert = Let‚Äôs Encrypt, observed).
    - Akamai ‚Üî IRS origin (unknown cert chain; invisible to taxpayer).
3. **Opaque to taxpayer:** The second leg is not verifiable by the end user. No evidence exists that it uses government CAs, FIPS 140-validated ciphers, or FedRAMP-scoped enclaves.
4. **AWS involvement:** `AWSALB*` cookies show traffic is routed through AWS Application Load Balancer before reaching IRS application servers.
5. **Auditability gap:** No client-side proof exists of FedRAMP-compliant handling between Akamai, AWS, and IRS servers.

**Implication:** Even if the browser shows a lock icon, decrypted taxpayer traffic exists at the Akamai edge and again at the AWS load balancer. Each trust transfer expands the potential exposure surface.

## Policy & Oversight Questions

- Why is a core taxpayer service embedding Google analytics and marketing infrastructure?
- Why is TLS terminating at Akamai rather than a federal enclave or .gov-operated CA?
- Are Akamai and AWS components in this workflow covered by FedRAMP authorization?
- Has IRS or Treasury performed independent code and traffic audits of these third-party components?
- What assurances do taxpayers have that DOM-level access and XHR hook capability are not being used for analytics or worse?

## Commercial Exploitation Scenario

Even without exfiltrating form fields, the Google analytics stack embedded in the EIN portal (`gtag.js`, `gtm.js`) transmits **page URLs (`dl`) and titles (`dt`)** to Google with each workflow step.

- **Implication:** Simply starting an EIN application is itself **sensitive taxpayer data** ‚Äî it reveals that a citizen or entity is creating a new business, trust, or estate.
- **Commercial linkage:** These telemetry hits are ingested by Google Ads systems, where they can be linked to browser cookies, device fingerprints, and logged-in Google accounts (e.g. Gmail, YouTube).
- **Observed outcome:** Users subsequently report receiving ads for business banking, incorporation services, and insurance shortly after interacting with the IRS EIN portal.
- **Risk vector:** Even absent SSNs or names, the *fact of applying* is monetizable intelligence, and it is shared with a commercial adtech ecosystem.

**Bottom line:** taxpayer intent data ‚Äî who is founding a new entity and when ‚Äî is not merely technical metadata. It is a regulated class of sensitive information, and its leakage through analytics constitutes a breach of trust.

## Conclusion

This repository focuses on **capability and provenance**. It does **not** assert that taxpayer PII was exfiltrated.

However, the presence of first-party adtech and commercial CDN telemetry in sensitive IRS workflows raises immediate questions:
- About the adequacy of current FedRAMP oversight,
- About the chain of trust from browser to federal servers,
- And about whether taxpayer expectations of confidentiality are being met.

**Bottom line:** If the IRS requires Americans to transmit their most sensitive identifiers, it must be able to prove ‚Äî not merely assert ‚Äî that no commercial third party can access or intercept that data.
